# Analyze_A-B_Test_Result

## Introduction
In this project, we gathered an A/B test data conducted by an e-commerce website to determine which page design to chose from two designs. The old design is assigned to a group of people identified to be control groupe, and the new design is assigned to another groupe called treatment. In this project we analyzed wether, or not, chosing the second design is of practical significance.
We will Investigate the test data to answer the following question:

> Is the proportion of control people who interacted with the old website design more than the propotion of treatment people who interacted with the new website design?

## Assecig
Starting by assecing programmatically, we looked at statistics and charactiristics of the data set such as the number
of rows and columns, duplicated data, missing data, and Null-value data. Programmatical assessment is mainly done through pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. The process of assecing consists of mainly for elements; completnece, validity, accuracy, consistency. Completnece refers to not missing any credential data. Validity refers to the process of recording the data correctly with units. Accuracy relates to how realistic is the data; how is it close to the true value? Finally, consistency is how all the data complement each other to provide a clear picture of phenomenum.
